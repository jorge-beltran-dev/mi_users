# Mi Users. Common user management functions

Mi Users provides common user management functions including:
* Remember me
* User account check-your-email validation
* Mail the user whenever their email or password changes

The latter point is especially important - should a malicious user succeed at hijacking a user's account or changing their password - they'll be immediately notified and hopefully - immediately notify you
